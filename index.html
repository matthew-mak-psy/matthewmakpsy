My research to-date primarily uses a study-test paradigm, where participants learn/read something in the study phase and I measure their learning subsequently in the test phase. The test phase may take place immediately after the study phase or after a significant delay, which may include a period of sleep. Recently, I have begun to incorporate more computational methods to complement my research, where I use corpus linguistics/NLP methods to inform psycholinguistic/learning theories. 

Finally, I am an avid supporter of open/reproducible science and am a member of multiple consortia (e.g., ChiPer, SPAM-L). I pre-register all my studies and recently completed my first registered report, a format that I am keen to adopt more often. I code in primarily R, but also in Python.

Education
I completed my DPhil/PhD in Experimental Psychology under the supervision of Professor Kate Nation at the University of Oxford (2021). Before that, I completed my MPhil in Applied Linguistics at the University of Cambridge (2017) and my BA in Linguistics/English at the University of Hong Kong (2016). 

Postdocs
From 2020-2023, I held a postdoc position at the University of York, where I worked on an ESRC-funded project on the influence of sleep/episodic memory in language comprehension (PI: Professor Gareth Gaskell). Before that, I held a part-time postdoc position at Oxford's Blavatnik School of Government in 2020-2021.
